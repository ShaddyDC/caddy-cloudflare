# caddy-cloudflare

The [caddy docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/caddy) compiled with [cloudflare dns](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare) and [caddy-security](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security) support, hopefully automatically updating. 


Use with 
```
docker pull ghcr.io/shaddydc/caddy-cloudflare:master
```
