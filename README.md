# caddy-cloudflare

The [caddy docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/caddy) compiled with cloudflare dns support, ~~hopefully automatically updating~~. 
**Since docker hub has disabled auto build, this will no longer stay up-to-date as of the time of writing.**


Use with 
```
docker pull shobble/caddy-cloudflare
```
