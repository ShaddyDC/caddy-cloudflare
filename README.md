# caddy-cloudflare

> **DEPRECATED**: this package has moved to [ShaddyDC/containers](https://github.com/ShaddyDC/containers/tree/main/apps/caddy-cloudflare). please update your references.

~~The [caddy docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/caddy) compiled with [cloudflare dns](https://github.com/caddy-dns/cloudflare) and [caddy-security](https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security) support, hopefully automatically updating.~~

## migration 

use the new package (`latest` instead of `master`):
```
docker pull ghcr.io/shaddydc/caddy-cloudflare:latest
```

though pinning to a specific tag is always recommended
